BATTLECRAFT

I solved the CSS challenges by first setting the background color and then creating basic shapes using simple divs. For the straight bars I used rectangles with width, height and background color. For the triangles I tried both the border trick and clip-path to get the right angles. Sometimes I rotated a rectangle with transform: rotate() to make diagonal lines. After placing the shapes with position: absolute and adjusting top and left values, the patterns matched the target.
