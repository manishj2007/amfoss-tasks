CineScope

This project is part of the CineScope SQL integration task. I imported the movies from a CSV file into a MySQL database using a Python script, then connected the given PySide6 dashboard to the database. The app can search by genre, year, rating, director or actor, display results in a table, let you choose which columns to see, and export the displayed data to a csv file.

To run it, install the requirements, set up the MySQL database, run import_csv.py to load the data, and then start the app with main.py.
