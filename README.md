AMFOSS PRAVESHAN 2025

Hi, I'm Manish, a first year at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeedam studying B-tech in CS(AI).I have knowledge in java and C. I am really willing to put a lot of effort and try to learn more.

Why should you choose me?

I will try to make sure i am totally committed in what I do. Once I start something, I will try to complete it fully. I like taking up challenges, learning new things on my own, and I wont give up easily.

How do I intend to contribute back to the club?

I will actively participate in tasks, projects, and events. I want to help others in the club if they get stuck and also share what I learn. Iâ€™ll try to bring consistency and dedication in whatever I do.

My fields of interest and how I plan to work on them

I am mainly interested in AI,machine learning and Open Source development.
I plan to improve by doing club tasks, contributing to open source projects, and learning step by step from seniors and teammates.I believe than joining this club would be a really great opportunity for me to improve my knowledge and also contribute it back to the club.
