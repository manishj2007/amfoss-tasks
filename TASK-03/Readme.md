 The Circularity Challenge

This task was to make a small game where you try to draw a perfect circle. 
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the Canvas API to let the user draw and then added a score system by checking how close the shape is to a circle. 
I also added the feature to save scores, some audio effects and a simple UI to make it fun. 
The project helped me learn some basics of html,css and javascript.
