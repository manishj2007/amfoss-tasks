I created a new Hugo site and added the PaperMod theme.
Then I edited the config file and added an About page.
After that I built the site using hugo which generated the static files in the public folder.
Finally I pushed the source code to my my-portfolio repository and deployed the public folder to the manishj2007.github.io repository to make the site live.
